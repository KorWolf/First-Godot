Firt stab at a game made in Godot! So far I like Godot better than Unity and already have ideas for more games.

Credit goes to Brackeys though for the level design etc. If you want to make the same thing check out his video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t=453s
Their video is called How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial.

Assets are from here: https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle

Assets CREDIT:

This pack is a combination of repackaged, remixed and original assets. Make sure to check out the original creators of the sprite assets - analogStudios_ and RottingPixels - they do amazing things.

Knight from camelot_, Slime from dungeonSprites_, World Tileset and Fruit from Four Seasons Platformer Tileset, Platforms and Coin from Four seasons platformer sprites.
